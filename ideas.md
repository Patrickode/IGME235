1. After recently watching a video about the game Sprouts, I've been inspired to try and remake it on a computer. This class project may be the perfect opportunity to do that, depending on how comfortable I'm feeling with everything when it gets around that time.
2. The ASCII Dungeon project I saw was cool, and I've kind of been considering doing some sort of ASCII game. Maybe I'll make a derivative of that. I'll definitely need to keep my ambition in check, though.
