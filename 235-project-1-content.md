# Monochromania
## High Concept
*"Bring order to the Chromaverse."*

A vibrant yet tranquil puzzle game where you turn haphazardly colored boards / grids into a single color, one square at a time.

## Platform
Monochromania's simple controls allow it to be played on **_desktop computers or mobile devices._**

## Theme
### Premise / Objective
Make everything in each level a singular color.
### Mood
Lively, Relaxed

## Aesthetics
- Being a game about color, Monochromania's palette will be expansive, and highly saturated. Its general style will be very minimalistic / cartoony.
- Sound will just as minimialistic as the graphics; snappy, satisfying, yet chilled-out clicks and hums. (Player moves, player fails, player succeeds) Music will be absent / ambient.
  - Perhaps the ambient music gets more full-bodied as the player gets closer to succeeding.

 ## Gameplay
The player must click or tap on squares of a grid adjacent to their character. (Each square is a different color; they may be randomly assigned, or a rainbow gradient, perhaps.) When a player clicks or taps on an adjacent square, their character moves to that square, and it turns into the player’s color, which is randomly determined at the start of the level. When the player moves onto a square that is already their color, it’s diluted, and the player must restart. (Maybe they don't have to restart, but now have to do the same for every other square.) There are start and end squares, and the player must get to the end after making every square the same color.

- Controls: Click / Tap on the grid.
- Onboarding: The very first level will have three squares in a line, a start square, an end square, and a normal square between them. An arrow or icon will encourage the player to click / tap the middle square, and then the end square, ending the level. The next level will have six squares, four in between the start and end; if the player goes straight to the exit, the uncolored squares will blink and the level will fail. This will demonstrate the goal and how to attempt it, and the game can start "proper."
  - While the mechanics and goal are simple, the planning and experimentation required to find a route through each square to the goal can increase quite dramatically, and fast.

## Other
Monochromania is extremely simple at the moment, because more often than not you can't scale too small. Its more complicated quirks, if there are any besides creative level design, still need some time to bubble to the surface of the ideation pot.

## About the Developer
My name is Patrick Mitchell, a second year Game Design and Development Major. I'm a programmer and writer who loves games. I’m interested in all sorts of programming languages, and find programming to be just as engrossing as writing my stories. The only game genre I don’t have at least a passing interest in is Horror, because I tend to scare myself with my own anticipation more than the game itself does. My ultimate goal is to make people happy, whether it’s with a game, a novel or something else I haven’t foreseen yet.
